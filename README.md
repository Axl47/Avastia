```
DSTOKEN=bot token
```
<br>

After this, setting up authorization for Spotify is required.
1. Go to [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and create an application
2. Opening it should reveal Client ID and Client Secret, save them somewhere for now.
3. Click on Edit Settings and go to Redirect URIs
4. Add this Redirect URI : `http://127.0.0.1/index.html`
5. Now run this command: `node authorize.js`
6. You will be asked:
     - Saving INFO in file or not | Select yes.
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret
     - Redirect URI or Redirect URL
     - Market | Choose 2 letter code on left side of your country name from [url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) ]
     - You will be given a link for authorizing. Just paste it in your browser and click on authorize and copy the link that you are redirected to | Redirected Link should start with `http://127.0.0.1/index.html`
     - Paste the url in Redirected URL
  
A folder named `.data` should've been created. **Do not** delete this, and **do not** share it online.
